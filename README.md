A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

<br>

## Overview
A simple yet powerful tool for managing and organizing daily tasks, a daily calendar application allows users to schedule events for work-day hour of the day (9am-5pm).

It's user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and add new events, which are saved in local storage when the save button is clicked within the corresponding time block. 

Additionally, the application color-codes each time block based on past, present, and future, helping the user stay on track with their daily activities.

## What I learnt:

```md

1. To review and apply concepts of DOM manipulation and advanced JavaScript in the development of the application.

2. To use jQuery to implement dynamic updates on the HTML and CSS.

3. To work with date and time in the browser using the Moment.js library.

4. To apply all the skills I've acquired such as implementing DOM manipulation strategies with jQuery, developing small games using JavaScript and jQuery, and creating time-based operations using Moment.js, in building the application.
